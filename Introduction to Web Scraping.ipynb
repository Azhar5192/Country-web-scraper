    "# Introduction to Web Scraping\n",
    "What is Web Scraping?\n",
    "Web Scraping is the automated process of extracting information from websites.\n",
    "Instead of manually copying data, a scraper reads and parses the webpage's code to collect the needed data.\n",
    "Used widely in data science for collecting:\n",
    "Product prices\n",
    "News articles\n",
    "Job listings\n",
    "Research datasets\n",
    "Why Use Web Scraping?\n",
    "Automate repetitive data collection tasks\n",
    "Access data that is not available via APIs\n",
    "Build datasets for Machine Learning models and Analytics\n",
    "Monitor websites for price changes, content updates, or news alerts\n",
    "When Not to Use Web Scraping\n",
    "If the site offers an official API, prefer that (it's cleaner and more stable).\n",
    "If scraping violates the site's Terms of Service.\n",
    "If the scraping harms the website (excessive requests can cause server overload).\n",
    "HTML Basics for Web Scraping\n",
    "What is HTML?\n",
    "HTML (HyperText Markup Language) structures content on the web.\n",
    "It's made up of elements (tags) like <div>, <p>, <h1>, <a>, etc.\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "<html>\n",
    "  <body>\n",
    "    <h1>Product Title</h1>\n",
    "    <p class=\"price\">$29.99</p>\n",
    "    <a href=\"/buy-now\">Buy Now</a>\n",
    "  </body>\n",
    "</html>\n",
    "\n",
    "Important HTML Elements for Scraping\n",
    "Tag\tMeaning\tCommon Use\n",
    "<div>\tDivision/Container\tGroup content\n",
    "<p>\tParagraph\tText blocks\n",
    "<h1>, <h2>, etc.\tHeadings\tTitles and sections\n",
    "<a>\tAnchor (links)\tURLs, navigation\n",
    "<img>\tImage\tPictures and icons\n",
    "<table>\tTable\tStructured tabular data\n",
    "Attributes Matter!\n",
    "HTML tags often have attributes like id, class, href, src.\n",
    "We use these attributes to target the correct elements.\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "<p class=\"price\">$29.99</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, the class=\"price\" attribute helps identify the price on the page.\n",
    "\n",
    "Quick CSS Basics for Scraping\n",
    "What is CSS?\n",
    "CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) controls the style and layout of HTML elements.\n",
    "For scraping, we mainly care about CSS selectors to find and extract data.\n",
    "Common CSS Selectors\n",
    "Selector\tMeaning\tExample\n",
    ".class\tSelects elements by class\t.price, .title\n",
    "#id\tSelects an element by id\t#main, #product-title\n",
    "tag\tSelects all elements of a tag\th1, div, p\n",
    "tag.class\tSelects a tag with class\tp.price, div.container\n",
    "Example: Selecting Elements\n",
    "HTML:\n",
    "\n",
    "<p class=\"price\">$29.99</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "CSS selector to target this:\n",
    "\n",
    "p.price\n",
    "\n",
    "In Python using BeautifulSoup:\n",
    "\n",
    "soup.select_one(\"p.price\")\n",
    "\n",
    "Tools We'll Use for Web Scraping\n",
    "requests → To download the HTML content of a webpage.\n",
    "BeautifulSoup → To parse and extract data from the HTML.\n",
    "(Optional) Selenium → For websites that load data dynamically with JavaScript.\n",
    "Summary\n",
    "Web scraping automates data extraction from websites.\n",
    "\n",
    "Understanding basic HTML structure and CSS selectors is crucial.\n",
    "\n",
    "Python provides powerful libraries to make web scraping easy."
